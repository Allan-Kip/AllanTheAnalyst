#  Bike Sales Dashboard (Excel Data Analysis Project)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes customer demographics and purchasing behavior to understand what influences bike sales.  
It involves data cleaning, transformation, pivot table analysis, and dashboard visualization using Microsoft Excel.

The goal is to identify key factors that drive bike purchases such as income, gender, marital status, region, and commute distance.

##  Dataset
[Dataset](https://github.com/Allan-Kip/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)

##  Data Cleaning
Performed using Excel tools and formulas:
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent values  
- Standardized categorical data (e.g., "M" → "Male", "S" → "Single")  
- Handled blanks and formatted numbers with commas and currency symbols  
- Added calculated fields:
  - **Age Bracket** (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old)
  - **Income Category** (Low, Medium, High)
##  Data Analysis
Using Pivot Tables and Charts:
- Compared **average income** between buyers and non-buyers  
- Analyzed **age group** vs **purchase rate**  
- Compared **gender distribution** of buyers  
- Studied **commute distance** and likelihood to buy  
- Explored **regional differences** in bike purchases

##  Dashboard Features
Interactive Excel Dashboard includes:
- **KPIs:** Total Customers, % Who Purchased, Average Income  
- **Bar Chart:** Purchases by Occupation   
- **Column Chart:** Commute Distance vs Purchase Rate  
- **Line Chart:** Age vs Purchase Trend  
- **Slicers:** Region, Gender, and Marital Status
##  Key Insights
- Middle-aged professionals with higher income are the most likely to purchase bikes.  
- Males purchased slightly more bikes than females.  
- Customers with short commutes (0–5 miles) were the main buyers.  
- The **Europe** region recorded the highest number of purchases.
